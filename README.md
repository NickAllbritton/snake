# snake - Rust

My own artistic take on the classic snake game.
This is a very simple game project to practice using rust and give my laptop a classic game to play.

Goal switches to a random color every frame similar to the super mario star power-up in feel. Snake is pinkish with a grey head.
I think, in the future, I will make the snake move from green to more red through interpolation or something simpler. 
Pause, restart, and quit hot-keys implemented. Score shown as tallies around the edge of the snake's world box. Every time
a goal is collected the snake speeds up by 1%.
